# AkuSupervisor Testing Guide

Current test scope: **Phase 2 ownership and Phase 3 foreground CLI checkpoint**

The visible CLI can now load a validated configuration and accept lifecycle
commands in its own terminal. Authenticated control from a separate CLI or HTTP
client is not implemented yet.

## 1. Automated verification

Open the integrated PowerShell terminal in Visual Studio:

```powershell
cd C:\WorkspaceCodex\AkuWorkspace\AkuSupervisor
.\scripts\test-phase2.ps1
```

The script runs formatting, strict Clippy, and all test targets. The final line
must begin with `PASS:`.

The important behavioral tests prove that:

- one owned parent and descendant are stopped together;
- an unrelated process remains alive;
- dropping the owner closes its Job Object and cleans up the tree;
- a port occupant is reported without being stopped;
- sixteen concurrent starts create only one owner; and
- console interruption cleans the owned tree before the fixture supervisor exits.
- the foreground CLI completes start, status, restart, stop, and quit against a
  real owned fixture tree.

## 2. Foreground supervisor

Given a valid service configuration:

```powershell
cargo run -- --config C:\path\to\services.json
```

For normal daily use, place the file at:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\AkuSupervisor\services.json
```

Then startup requires no application arguments:

```powershell
cargo run
```

For this AkuWorkspace pilot, the source profile is checked in at:

```text
C:\WorkspaceCodex\AkuWorkspace\AkuSupervisor\config\akuworkspace.services.json
```

It registers `akusidecar` using `C:\nvm4w\nodejs\npm.cmd run dev` from the
AkuSidecar repository. Startup prints both the absolute selected path and its
source, for example:

```text
Configuration: C:\Users\Force\AppData\Local\AkuSupervisor\services.json
Configuration source: default user configuration
```

`AKU_SUPERVISOR_CONFIG` may override the default location. An explicit
`--config` path has the highest priority.

To verify loading without starting AkuSidecar, enter `quit` at the prompt. To
perform the first manual lifecycle test, use:

```text
status
start akusidecar initial supervised launch
status
stop akusidecar manual test complete
quit
```

The configured `/api/health` expectation is reserved for Phase 4. At the current
checkpoint, `running` means the owned process tree was launched; it does not yet
mean the HTTP JSON expectation passed.

The terminal displays the current service table. Available commands are:

```text
status
start <service> [reason]
stop <service> [reason]
restart <service> [reason]
help
quit
```

Executable, arguments, working directory, and environment always come from the
validated configuration. Interactive input can select only a registered
service and supply an auditable reason.

## 3. Visible manual process-tree demo

Build the demo, then execute it directly so Cargo is not an intermediary for
the Ctrl+C signal:

```powershell
cd C:\WorkspaceCodex\AkuWorkspace\AkuSupervisor
cargo build --example phase2_process_tree_demo
.\target\debug\examples\phase2_process_tree_demo.exe
```

The demo prints one supervisor PID and at least two owned PIDs. It waits for 30
seconds, or you can press Ctrl+C. A successful cleanup ends with output similar
to:

```text
Cleanup complete.
Before: [1234, 5678]
After : []
Forced: false
```

`After: []` is the essential assertion. `Forced` may be either `false` or
`true`: it records whether the child cooperated before the bounded forced path.

To inspect the processes while the demo is waiting, open a second PowerShell
terminal and use the PIDs printed by the demo:

```powershell
Get-Process -Id <PID1>,<PID2>
```

After cleanup, the same command should report that those processes no longer
exist. Do not substitute unrelated PIDs into any termination command; the demo
itself only operates on its Job Object.

## 4. Current limitation

The foreground CLI checkpoint does not yet expose HTTP authentication,
persistent event retrieval, or bounded log commands. AkuSidecar live validation
remains Phase 4 and will include a real reasoning invocation, not only
`/api/health`.

# AkuSupervisor Testing Guide

Current test scope: **Phase 2 Windows process ownership**

The Phase 3 CLI has not been implemented yet. You can verify the lifecycle
engine and operating-system safety boundary now, but commands such as
`start akusidecar` and `restart akusidecar` are not available yet.

## 1. Automated verification

Open the integrated PowerShell terminal in Visual Studio:

```powershell
cd C:\WorkspaceCodex\AkuWorkspace\AkuSupervisor
.\scripts\test-phase2.ps1
```

The script runs formatting, strict Clippy, and all test targets. The final line
must begin with `PASS:`.

The important behavioral tests prove that:

- one owned parent and descendant are stopped together;
- an unrelated process remains alive;
- dropping the owner closes its Job Object and cleans up the tree;
- a port occupant is reported without being stopped;
- sixteen concurrent starts create only one owner; and
- console interruption cleans the owned tree before the fixture supervisor exits.

## 2. Visible manual process-tree demo

Build the demo, then execute it directly so Cargo is not an intermediary for
the Ctrl+C signal:

```powershell
cd C:\WorkspaceCodex\AkuWorkspace\AkuSupervisor
cargo build --example phase2_process_tree_demo
.\target\debug\examples\phase2_process_tree_demo.exe
```

The demo prints one supervisor PID and at least two owned PIDs. It waits for 30
seconds, or you can press Ctrl+C. A successful cleanup ends with output similar
to:

```text
Cleanup complete.
Before: [1234, 5678]
After : []
Forced: false
```

`After: []` is the essential assertion. `Forced` may be either `false` or
`true`: it records whether the child cooperated before the bounded forced path.

To inspect the processes while the demo is waiting, open a second PowerShell
terminal and use the PIDs printed by the demo:

```powershell
Get-Process -Id <PID1>,<PID2>
```

After cleanup, the same command should report that those processes no longer
exist. Do not substitute unrelated PIDs into any termination command; the demo
itself only operates on its Job Object.

## 3. Current limitation

This demo uses self-contained fixture processes. Testing AkuSidecar itself
begins after the Phase 3 visible CLI can resolve a validated service profile.
The Phase 4 acceptance test will then include a real reasoning invocation, not
only `/api/health`.
